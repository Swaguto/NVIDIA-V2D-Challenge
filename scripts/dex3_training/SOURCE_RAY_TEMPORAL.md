# Source-ray geometry and finite temporal pose graphs

These helpers construct and assess hypotheses before an expensive physical
rollout. Neither helper changes the original source observations or their
missing, inferred, direct and metric flags.

## Root rotations from a point and ray

`source_ray_kinematics.ray_bound_root_rotations` intersects the sphere traced
by a fixed local point about a fixed root translation with a declared image
ray. Each intersection uses the minimum rotation from the supplied reference
that maps the local vector onto the ray. This is an explicit twist convention,
not enumeration of the full rotation family. Antiparallel ambiguity is separate
from an empty nonsingular result. Ray parameters retain the caller's convention;
the helper does not silently normalize the direction or infer measured depth.

Check original root bounds, source-image/model-orientation nonregression,
actual other fingers, native collision geometry and trajectory limits after
construction. Source-model orientation remains an estimate, not a measured
robot wrist pose. Eighteen focused tests cover sphere branches, tangency,
transforms, minimum swing, ambiguity and strict input contracts.

## Finite temporal reachability

`temporal_pose_graph.finite_temporal_reachability` accepts one finite joint-pose
bank per clock row and explicit actual joint position/velocity limits. The
component and adjacent/second-added caps apply against the original reference.
Velocity applies to actual joint angles and actual timestamp differences.

A consecutive-node pair is the state, allowing exact second-difference checks
and bidirectional trimming of the supplied graph. The result includes a
minimum-cost complete path when one exists, forward/backward pair counts,
complete-path viable nodes and every empty bank. Missing clock rows are not
skipped. Invalid positions fail instead of silently being filtered.

The graph does not certify unsampled solutions, root motion, source accuracy,
continuous swept collision, native motors, contacts, dynamics or task success.
Sixteen focused tests include an independent exhaustive enumeration, a greedy
dead end, actual clock velocities, original-reference corrections and empty
banks. Preserve a caller's original numerical tolerances explicitly.

## Retained e037 study

A joint-only linear bridge can connect the two saved isolated source/native
poses under the original finger bounds. This does not supply a source- or
collision-feasible trajectory. The first finite ray-based bank has 58 nodes
and six missing rows; its original fixed-pixel convention excludes some known
allowed source-image motion. A new construction projects into the original
image-error disks, retaining the same source thresholds. It reuses the old
nodes and produces 2,003 eligible finite nodes, but still lacks 109/112/114
and has no complete path. These finite failures are not global infeasibility.

The isolated poses are controls, not mandatory measured robot angles. No new
reference replaces the three verified components. Full original source/motion,
1 mm native/self, swept, actual motor and grasp checks remain before training.

## Common-root twist intervals

`source_root_twist.source_orientation_twist_domain` keeps the remaining
one-dimensional rotation around an already mapped local vector. Its closed-form
quaternion sinusoid describes the supplied source-model orientation error cap.
The twist preserves that robot point, not measured human depth or contact.

`partition_root_twist_domain` intersects that domain with the caller's original
world-component rotation box using numerical principal-log envelopes. It saves
every split and rejected/inside/unresolved leaf, including cut-locus or budget
uncertainty. The envelopes use outward numerical padding and are **not** a
formal libm directed-rounding certificate. Source images, actual fingers,
native collisions and full motion remain separate checks.

Twenty-two focused tests cover closed-form domains and seams, independent
rotation grids, point preservation, component enclosures, complete leaf cover,
cut-locus/budget uncertainty and strict contracts. Independent private checks
on actual e037 geometry validate selected isolated poses; their sparse insertion
still fails original joint speed and temporal caps. No new reference replaces
the three verified components, and no physical or policy success is implied.
